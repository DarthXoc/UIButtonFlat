# UIButtonFlat

## Summary
This extension provides the ability to easily create a UIButton with a flat style, a border or both.

To learn more about this project, please visit it on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/DarthXoc/UIButtonFlat).

## Demo
Give UIButtonFlat a try without having to type a single line of code with the [UIButtonFlat Demo](https://github.com/DarthXoc/UIButtonFlat-Demo).

## Installation
Simply add UIButtonFlat via Swift Package Manager to your project... that's it!

## Usage 
You can choose to create a _UIButtonFlat_ control in the same way that you would create a stock _UIButton_ control, either via Storyboards, programmatically or through a mixture of the two.

### Via Storyboards
1) Select the UIButton that you wish to use
2) Switch to the Identity Inspector
3) Update the UIButton's class to 'UIButtonFlat'
4) Switch to the Attributes Inspector
5) Switch _Type_ to 'Custom'
6) You can find the configuration options under the _Button Flat_ heading

### Via Code
Import `UIButtonFlat`. Then create a _UIButtonFlat_ control in the same way that you would create a _UIButton_ control, except that instead of using _UIButton_, use the _UIButtonFlat_ type. Because _UIButtonFlat_ in an extension of _UIButton_, all of _UIButton_'s functions will be inherited. Please note that if you are creating a _UIButtonFlat_ from scratch and not connecting to a button that you've either fully or partially configured in a Storyboard, you will need to declare it's type as `.custom` like so:

```
let button: UIButtonFlat = UIButtonFlat(type: .custom)
```
